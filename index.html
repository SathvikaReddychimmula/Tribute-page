        <h2>ABOUT THE LEGEND</h2>
        <p class="para">Whenever we hear of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, we remember him as the one who gave the slogan “Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it”. He is also remembered as the father of Indian unrest. The title “Lokmanya” is given to Bal Gangadhar Tilak to honour him. It translates to being accepted by the people as a leader.

            He is considered the first leader of the Indian Independence movement.
           
           Tilak was a strong advocate of Swaraj, which means self-rule. While the moderates wanted to form a government under British rule, leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak wanted a rule without British interference.</p>
        <h3>&#8680;Early Life  </h3>
        <p class="para">Bal Gangadhar Tilak was named Keshav at birth. He was born in the year 1856 on the 23rd of July. Chikhali is the original village of Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Tilak’s father was a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was young. When Tilak turned 16 years of age, he was married to Tapibai.

            This marriage took place before Tilak’s father died. Tilak obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts in mathematics. He studied this at the Deccan College of Pune. Tilak took on a job as a teacher in a private school in Pune. Later, Tilak also took an L.L.B course and obtained a law degree from the Government Law College.</p>

        <p class="para">Tilak is regarded as the father of Indian unrest. He is remembered as the one who gave the slogan “Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it”. He spent his career fighting for freedom in India. He was the most popular Indian political leader during his time. Tilak was a radical nationalist, and his approach was extremist. There were numerous times when Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested and had to spend time in prison. Due to this reason, he was called the father of Indian unrest.</p>
        <h3>&#8680;Tilak started significant movements. </h3>
        <p class="para">The partition of Bengal enraged the general public in India. To protest against this, Tilak started the Swadeshi movement and the Boycott movement. In this movement, he urged the people in India to boycott goods from the British and instead make use of goods manufactured in India.

            As Bal Gangadhar Tilak was prohibited from speaking during the 1907 Congress session, the radicals decided to break into protest. The 1907 session of congress gained a violent turn, and mayhem was caused. This resulted in the separation of the extremists from the moderates. </p>
        <h3>&#8680;Final Years and Passing</h3>
        <p class="para">Bal Gangadhar Tilak continued to be active in the Indian National Congress and the Home Rule Movement in the final years of his life. However, his health began to deteriorate, and he faced financial difficulties due to his dedication to the cause.

            Tragically, on August 1, 1920, this great leader and freedom fighter passed away. His death was a tremendous loss to the Indian independence movement, but his legacy lived on in the hearts of millions.</p>
